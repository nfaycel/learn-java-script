# learn-java-script

Everything I know about JavaScript which I gained from watching The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!

this repo will contain all the code written in the course in addition to a lot of explanations for the code in my own style.

### what exactly is covered in the course?

- Build 5 beautiful real-world projects for your portfolio! In these projects, you will learn how to plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns

- Master the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more

- Learn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining (ES2020), and more

- How JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.

- Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.

- Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. [This is like a small standalone course]

- Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls. [This is like a small standalone course]

- Learn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel (module bundler), Babel, and ES6 modules

### What youâ€™ll learn
